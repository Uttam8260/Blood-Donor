# Blood-Donor
A blood donor app using JSP and Servlets enables users to register as donors, search for nearby donors, and request blood donations. JSP handles the frontend, displaying forms and donor information, while Servlets manage requests, process data, and interact with a database to track donor records and blood requests in real-time.
